    question: "If all roses are flowers and some flowers are red, which statement must be true?",
    options: ["All roses are red", "Some roses might be red", "No roses are red", "All red things are roses"],

    question: "All birds can fly. Penguins are birds. Therefore:",
    options: ["Penguins can fly", "The first statement is false", "Penguins are not birds", "Flying is not necessary for birds"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "This is a classic example of a false premise. Since we know penguins cannot fly, the first statement 'All birds can fly' must be false.",
